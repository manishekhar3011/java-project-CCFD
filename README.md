Credit Card Fraud Detection
This project is a simple credit card fraud detection system built using Java and Hibernate. It aims to detect suspicious transactions based on specific criteria, such as large transaction amounts and unusual transaction patterns. The system stores transaction data in a database, flags fraudulent activity, and generates fraud alerts for further investigation.

Features
Transaction Tracking: Allows recording and managing credit card transactions, including transaction amounts, merchant names, and types.
Fraud Detection: Identifies suspicious transactions based on predefined thresholds (e.g., high transaction amounts).
Fraud Alerts: Automatically generates fraud alerts when a suspicious transaction is detected.
Database Integration: Uses Hibernate to interact with a relational database (MySQL in this case) to store transactions and fraud alerts.
Technologies Used
Java: Core programming language for implementing the system logic.
Hibernate ORM: Used for ORM (Object Relational Mapping) to manage the database interactions.
MySQL: Relational database for storing transaction and fraud alert data.
JDBC: For database connectivity in conjunction with Hibernate.
Prerequisites
Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:

Java 8+: The project is developed with Java 8 or later versions.
MySQL Database: A MySQL server with a database configured to store transaction data.
Maven or Gradle: Dependency management tool to manage Hibernate and other libraries.
Hibernate 5+: ORM framework for database interactions.
Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository
First, clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/credit-card-fraud-detection.git
2. Set up MySQL Database
Create a new MySQL database and user:

sql
Copy code
CREATE DATABASE frauddetectiondb;
CREATE USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON frauddetectiondb.* TO 'root'@'localhost';
3. Configure Hibernate
Open hibernate.cfg.xml and update the database connection settings:

xml
Copy code
<property name="hibernate.connection.url">jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/frauddetectiondb</property>
<property name="hibernate.connection.username">root</property>
<property name="hibernate.connection.password">password</property>
4. Build the project
If you're using Maven, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
mvn clean install
For Gradle, use:

bash
Copy code
gradle build
5. Run the Application
After building the project, you can run it from the command line or IDE. The system will handle the recording of transactions and fraud detection.

Example of adding a transaction and detecting fraud:

java
Copy code
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Set up session factory
        SessionFactory factory = FactoryProvider.getFactory();

        // Example transaction
        TransactionDao transactionDao = new TransactionDao(factory);
        Transaction transaction = new Transaction("1234567890123456", "Amazon", 1500.00, "Purchase", "Completed");

        // Save the transaction
        transactionDao.saveTransaction(transaction);

        // Check for suspicious transactions
        List<Transaction> suspiciousTransactions = transactionDao.getSuspiciousTransactions();
        for (Transaction t : suspiciousTransactions) {
            System.out.println("Suspicious Transaction: " + t.getTransactionId());
        }
    }
}
6. Database Schema
Here is the basic structure of the tables:

sql
Copy code
-- Transaction Table
CREATE TABLE Transaction (
    transactionId INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    cardNumber VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    merchantName VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
    transactionAmount DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
    transactionType VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    status VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
);

-- FraudAlert Table
CREATE TABLE FraudAlert (
    alertId INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    cardNumber VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    alertMessage VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
    isFraudulent BOOLEAN NOT NULL
);
7. Running the Application
Once everything is set up, you can run the application, and it will:

Save transactions in the database.
Flag transactions as suspicious if they exceed a certain threshold (e.g., transactions over $1000).
Generate fraud alerts for transactions flagged as suspicious.
